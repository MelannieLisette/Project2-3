         <p>Makeup is my life because it’s part of my job as a beauty editor and product 
         developer, but even I use makeup much, much less than I did before. My guess is that 
         it’s the same for you too! The last two years saw our makeup kits languishing in half-forgotten 
         drawers, waiting to see the light of day. Now that the world is opening up a little bit more, 
         you may not help but wonder: is this still ok to use? How do you decide what to keep and what to throw away?

            <p><small>Hi! My name is Melannie Lisette and I created & run this lifestyle & beauty blog. 
            Growing up in LA, I had always been surrounded by glitz and glam & in a time when QUEENS like 
            Britney Spears, Destiny's Child, & the Spice Girls <i>(just to name a few!)</i> reigned.</p> 
            <br>
            <p>I fell in love with this energy; this confidence and exuberance that emananted from the likes of such beautiful and talented women.
            I was entranced and empowered; and I was put on the right path toward loving myself so that I could set the world on fire. I want to share this
            vision with you! I want you to set the world ablaze with me &#9825;</small>
